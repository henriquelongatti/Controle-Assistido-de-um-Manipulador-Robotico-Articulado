# Abstract
This paper presents the construction of an articulated robotic manipulator with three degrees of freedom, based on an industrial robot, built with Arduino and commercial servomotors. To control this robot, a shared control technique based on potential fields is proposed to reduce the cognitive effort that must be generated by the user, reducing the amount of commands to accomplish a task. In addition, the calculation of diredt and inverse kinematics through Denavit-Hartenberg and descending gradient, respectively, are developed with sufficeint computinal time to be run in real time.
